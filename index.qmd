This is a poem. It's called ["Bellringer", by Rita Dove](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2019-in-review/our-year-in-poems). @cr-intro

| {#cr-intro .cr-text  .scale-to-fill}
| Across the [268,597 square miles of Texas]{#cr-h1} access to women’s healthcare is deeply
| uneven. Large regions of the state function 
| as [“healthcare deserts,”]{#cr-h2} 
| where high- population communities have few or sometimes no access to nearby
| clinics providing essential services
| like contraception, cancer screenings, and preventive care. Underfunding,
| clinic closures,and restrictive and changing policies have widened these gaps,
| leaving low-income, rural,
| and underserved Texans facing [long travel distances]{#cr-b1}, 
| limited transportation options, and
| months-long wait times. These barriers make timely, 
| comprehensive healthcare out of reach
| for many, underscoring the urgent need for solutions that meet people where they are.
| That’s where mobile health care units come in


The author refers to their birth twice: one here... [@cr-intro]{hlz="cr-h1,cr-h2"}

... and again, further down. [@cr-intro]{hlz="cr-b1,cr-b2"}

Let's look at a small limerick. @cr-mylimerick

| {#cr-text .cr-text}
| The limerick packs [big test]{#cr-text1}
|   In space that is quite economical.

The phrase 'highlight this' is quite important here! [@cr-text]{hlz="cr-text1"}
