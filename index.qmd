# Test other sticky block types

First paragraph.

::: {}
This is a para nested in a div. These two first bits don't trigger anything...
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-pink"}
This is an image with the sticky tag on the div.
:::

:::{#cr-pink}
x![This is a caption](pink-desktop.png)
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-blue"}
This is an image with the sticky tag on Image itself.

I've replaced its margin with some padding to demonstrate that you can give it a larger "surface" area on which to trigger scroll events.
:::

![](blue-desktop.png){#cr-blue}

::::{.column-screen-inset style="background-color: #dddddd; padding: 50px;"}
Here's a little non-scrolling interlude before our next scrolly section!

This is a scatterplot. @cr-scatter

:::{#cr-scatter}
```{r}
#| echo: false

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$dist)
```
:::

This is a histogram. @cr-hist

:::{#cr-hist}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "This is a caption."
#| fig-height: 4

hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

This is a list (a block element). @cr-list

:::{#cr-list}
1. Apple
2. Banana
:::

This is display math, but I'm making it a bit longer so that it covers a few lines. @cr-displaymath

::: {#cr-displaymath style="font-size: 300%;"}

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{y} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \\
&= 3.4 + 1.2 x
\end{align}

This is a poem. It's called ["Bellringer", by Rita Dove](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2019-in-review/our-year-in-poems). @cr-intro

| {#cr-intro .cr-text  .scale-to-fill}
| Across the [268,597 square miles of Texas]{#cr-h1} access to women’s healthcare is deeply
| uneven. Large regions of the state function 
| as [“healthcare deserts,”]{#cr-h2} 
| where high- population communities have few or sometimes no access to nearby
| clinics providing essential services
| like contraception, cancer screenings, and preventive care. Underfunding,
| clinic closures,and restrictive and changing policies have widened these gaps,
| leaving low-income, rural,
| and underserved Texans facing [long travel distances]{#cr-b1}, 
| limited transportation options, and
| months-long wait times. These barriers make timely, 
| comprehensive healthcare out of reach
| for many, underscoring the urgent need for solutions that meet people where they are.
| That’s where mobile health care units come in


The author refers to their birth twice: one here... [@cr-intro]{hlz="cr-h1,cr-h2"}

... and again, further down. [@cr-intro]{hlz="cr-b1,cr-b2"}

Let's look at a small limerick. @cr-mylimerick

| {#cr-text .cr-text}
| The limerick packs [big test]{#cr-text1}
|   In space that is quite economical.

The phrase 'highlight this' is quite important here! [@cr-text]{hlz="cr-text1"}
