    "text": "MOBILE WOMEN’S HEALTH CLINICS IN TEXAS\n\nHighlighting Need\nAcross the 268,597 square miles of Texas, access to women’s healthcare is deeply uneven. Large regions of the state function as “healthcare deserts,” where high- population communities have few or sometimes no access to nearby clinics providing essential services like contraception, cancer screenings, and preventive care. Many rural Texans face long travel distances, limited transportation options, and months-long wait times.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese barriers make timely, comprehensive healthcare out of reach for many, underscoring the urgent need for solutions that meet people where they are.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s where mobile health care units come in.\n\n\n\n\nUse the bar on the left to scroll through this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Health Outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more.\n\n\n\n\nThis is quite important here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact on women’s health has been\nespecially severe. Nearly half of\nTexas counties (46.5%) are classified as\nmaternity care deserts,\nmeaning they lack access to\nbirthing facilities\nor maternity care providers altogether.\nFor thousands of women, even basic\npregnancy care requires\ntraveling far from home,\n4.6% of Texas women live\nmore than 30 minutes from\nthe nearest birthing hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Mapping Need.\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows counties that . Use the pan tool to view the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4: Introduce the concept of mobile clinics\nMobile healthcare units are designed to close gaps by bringing services directly to patients and communities, especially in rural areas. Mobile clinics reduce the distance, time, and cost barriers that prevent many women from accessing care. Mobile clinics set up in trusted community spaces and adapt their routes based on need. They offer a flexible, efficient way to deliver essential women’s health services, such as birth control, cancer screenings, prenatal care, and preventive visits. For women who don’t have reliable access to transportation, mobile clinics can be a literal lifeline. When speaking to patients, they praise the convenience, as they are no longer required to travel hours from home, miss work, school, or childcare. Mobile clinics don’t just expand access; they help ensure care happens earlier, more consistently, and on patients’ terms.\n\n\nSection 5: Legislation\n\n\n\nDuring the 89th Legislative Session, the Texas Women’s Healthcare Coalition and its partners secured $20 million in new state funding to expand mobile women’s health units across Texas, doubling down on a commitment to meet women where they are. This investment represents $10 million more than the amount secured in 2023, signaling growing legislative recognition of mobile healthcare as a critical solution to access gaps. This funding is the direct result of sustained, collective advocacy and a willingness by providers to find innovative solutions to reach the counties around them.\n\n\nSection 6: On the road\nA single mobile health unit can extend care across multiple counties that aren’t served by brick-and-mortar clinics. This map illustrates how mobile units move across regions with limited or no permanent healthcare infrastructures, reaching women who would otherwise face transportation barriers, or even no access at all.\n\n\nSection 7: On the ground\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more.\n\n\n\n\nScroll on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Now we’re able to do a\nfull clinic,\njust like a brick-and-mortar clinic,\njust on wheels.”\n— Dr. Perales, DNP, APRN, CNS-BC\nClinic Service Director, STFPHC"
