Large regions of the state function\nas “healthcare deserts,”\nwhere high- population communities have few or sometimes no access to nearby\nclinics providing essential services\nlike contraception, cancer screenings, and preventive care. Underfunding,\nclinic closures,and restrictive and changing policies have widened these gaps,\nleaving low-income, rural,\nand underserved Texans facing long travel distances,\nlimited transportation options, and\nmonths-long wait times. These barriers make timely,\ncomprehensive healthcare out of reach\nfor many, underscoring the urgent need for solutions that meet people where they are.\nThat’s where mobile health care units come in\n\n\nThe limerick packs big test\n  In space that is quite economical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n  C --&gt; E[Result two]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\nrun\n\nrun\n\n\n\nintr\n\nintr\n\n\n\nrun--intr\n\n\n\n\nrunbl\n\nrunbl\n\n\n\nintr--runbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End"
